# Graphics Programming Practice (C++)

This repository contains my graphics programming practice projects.
I am building these to understand rendering, game loops, and collision detection using C++.

Currently learning computer graphics fundamentals alongside DSA and core CS concepts.

## Projects

### Moving Balls Simulation
- Automatic ball movement
- Collision detection
- Multiple objects
- Window rendering

Location: /movingballs

### (Add future projects here)
- Gravity simulation
- Particle system
- Pong game
- Physics engine basics

---

## Tech Stack
- C++
- raylib (graphics library)
- VS Code

---

## Why This Repository

I created this repository to:

- Learn real-time rendering
- Understand game loop structure
- Practice object interaction logic
- Apply mathematics in programming
- Move beyond only DSA problem solving

## How to Run Projects

Each project folder contains its own instructions.

General steps:

1. Install raylib
2. Compile source files
3. Run executable

## Learning Goals

- Graphics programming fundamentals
- Physics simulation basics
- Game development concepts
- Real-world C++ application building
